###  Grey Code

📘 Gray Code in Computer Organization & Digital Design
In my academics, I have a module called "Computer Organization and Digital Design."
As part of this module, I need to learn about Gray Code and its conversion between Binary and Gray Code.

In this post, I will explain:
    ✅ What is Gray Code?
    ✅ Why is it important?
    ✅ How to convert between Binary and Gray Code?

Let’s dive in! 🚀

🌟 Gray Code & Its Conversion 🌟
🔹 What is Gray Code?
Gray Code is a special binary number system where only one bit changes between consecutive numbers. It is also known as Reflected Binary Code.

🔹 Why is Gray Code Important?
    ✅ Reduces Errors – Prevents errors in digital circuits by changing only one bit at a time.
    ✅ Used in Digital Systems – Found in rotary encoders, communication systems, and error correction mechanisms.
    ✅ Simplifies Hardware – Useful in counters & digital circuits for efficient processing.

🔄 Binary to Gray Code Conversion
📝 Steps to Convert Binary → Gray Code:
1️⃣ First Gray bit = First Binary bit.
2️⃣ Each next Gray bit = Previous Binary bit XOR Current Binary bit.

✨ Example: Convert 1011 (Binary) → Gray Code

1st Gray bit = 1 (Same as Binary MSB)  
2nd Gray bit = 1 XOR 0 = 1  
3rd Gray bit = 0 XOR 1 = 1  
4th Gray bit = 1 XOR 1 = 0  
🎯 Result: 1011 (Binary) → 1110 (Gray Code)
